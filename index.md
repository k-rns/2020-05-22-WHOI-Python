Workshops always have the cleanest, best examples of data tables to use, don't they? These tables always seem to be immediately usable for analysis. Getting a raw table usable for analysis is a process called "data wrangling". In this workshop we'll show you how to get to this perfect table using Python and the package Pandas. 

Doing this process correctly will not only make you more efficient, but it will also make your data easier to reuse in the future. 

The workshop is sponsored by a WHOI Academic Programs Doherty Award and a DDVPR Technical Staff Training Award

<h2 id="why-wrangling">Am I a data wrangler?</h2>
The process called "data wrangling", i.e., manipulating data into a usable form and diagnosing data quality issues often constitutes the most tedious and time-consuming aspect of analysis.

SYLLABUS

Show what topics will be covered.

1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
intend to teach.
4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
'tools/check' as well.

  Syllabus pending - Draft
</p>

<p>
This workshop is based on a few workshops developed by the Carpentries (See <a href="https://carpentries.org">https://carpentries.org</a>  for more information about the Carpentries organisation.) and by Joe Futrelle (WHOI):
<ul>
  <li><a href=" https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/">Data Organization in Spreadsheets for Ecologists</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/">Plotting and Programming in Python</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/">Data Analysis and Visualization for Ecologists</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/WHOIGit/pandas-talk/">Python and the Pandas package</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
  
<p>
  Part 1. Preparing your table so python can understand it. There are some best practices in order to set up your spreadsheet in order to do so:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/01-format-data/index.html">structuring towards a "flat file" lay-out</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/02-common-mistakes/index.html">Formatting problems: multiple tables and tabs, zeros and problematic null values, colors to convey information, 1 piece of information in a cell, problematic field names, special characters</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/03-dates-as-data/index.html">dates as data</a></li>
</ul>
</p> 
 
 <p>
  Part 2. python and pandas

  <li>Import data, series and dataframes</li>  
  <li>Groups and exploration of dataframes</li>
  <li>Indexing, slicing and subsetting dataframes</li>
  <li>Combining dataframes</li>
  </ul>

SETUP

Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
and end easier to find.

This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
'tools/check' as well.

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>
  To participate in this workshop, you will need access to a spreadsheet program (Excel, LibreOffice,...), Python and Jupyter notebooks. In addition you will need an up-to-date web browser. Set-up instructions for your software can be found <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/setup-python-workshop.html">here</a> (Instructions from Data Carpentry Ecology workshops-with Python) . From these instructions install:
  <ul>
    <li>A spreadsheet program (Excel is fine, or you can install the open source software LibreOffice)</li>
    <li>Python and Jupyter notebooks</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Please make sure you have installed all the required packages before the start of this workshop. We will be holding an on-line data lab with Stace Beaulieu on May 20 and can help you install the packages if necessary. </p>
  

<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "{{site.swc_github}}/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
